*Tom is a designer at ABC firm. He is assigned with the task of designing a protective head gear targeted at workers of construction industry. With plenty of design thinking mechanisms at his disposal, he has the liberty to choose any one out of them and proceed. Keeping in mind, the risks involved in recalling the product due to poor design, he has to stick to a robust design mechanism. Out of the design thinking mechanisms that you have learned in the course, which one do you think would best fit Tom's purpose?
